    <h1>About Carl Jung</h1>
    <p>Carl Gustav Jung (1875–1961) was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology. His work profoundly influenced psychology, philosophy, literature, and religious studies. Below are key details about his life and contributions:

        Early Life and Education
        Born on July 26, 1875, in Kesswil, Switzerland.
        His father was a Protestant pastor, and his early exposure to religion influenced his later work.
        Studied medicine at the University of Basel, where he developed an interest in psychiatry.
        Career and Contributions
        Association with Sigmund Freud (1907–1913)
        
        In 1907, Jung met Sigmund Freud, and they developed a close intellectual relationship.
        Freud saw Jung as his successor in the psychoanalytic movement.
        However, Jung disagreed with Freud’s emphasis on sexuality as the primary force in the unconscious mind.
        Their split in 1913 led Jung to develop his own psychological theories.
        Analytical Psychology
        
        Jung founded analytical psychology, distinct from Freud’s psychoanalysis.
        He introduced key concepts such as:
        The Collective Unconscious – A level of unconscious shared among all humans, containing archetypes (universal symbols and themes found in myths, dreams, and religions).
        Archetypes – Fundamental symbols such as the Hero, Shadow, Anima/Animus, and Self.
        Individuation – The process of integrating different aspects of the psyche to achieve personal growth and self-realization.
        Personality Types
        
        Jung classified personality into introversion and extraversion, which later influenced the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator).
        He also developed the four psychological functions:
        Thinking
        Feeling
        Sensation
        Intuition
        Study of Religion and Mythology
        
        Jung was deeply interested in religion, alchemy, and mythology.
        His works explored symbols in different cultures and their psychological significance.
        He studied Eastern philosophies (such as Taoism and Buddhism) and their relation to psychology.
        The Red Book (Liber Novus)
        
        A personal manuscript in which Jung documented his visions and reflections.
        It remained unpublished until 2009 and provided insight into his inner experiences and theories.
        Major Works
        Psychological Types (1921) – Introduces the concepts of introversion, extraversion, and psychological functions.
        Modern Man in Search of a Soul (1933) – Discusses the relevance of Jungian psychology in modern life.
        The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious (1951) – Explores the universal symbols shared across humanity.
        Memories, Dreams, Reflections (1962, posthumous) – His autobiography, offering insight into his personal and intellectual life.
        Later Life and Legacy
        Jung continued to develop his theories and engage in psychotherapy until his death on June 6, 1961.
        His ideas influenced psychotherapy, literature, art, spirituality, and even modern personality studies.
        Concepts like shadow work, archetypes, and the collective unconscious are widely used today in psychology, self-development, and philosophy.</p>
