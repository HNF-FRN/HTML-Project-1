    <h1>Jungian Psychology</h1>
    <p>Jungian psychology, also known as analytical psychology, was developed by Carl Gustav Jung as a response to and evolution of Freud’s psychoanalysis. Jung believed that the human psyche is complex and consists of multiple layers, including the conscious, personal unconscious, and collective unconscious. His work explores the deep structures of the mind, the symbolic nature of human experience, and the journey toward self-realization.</p>
